# VisUQ-HydRA
We propose a computational framework that links the various components relevant for the estimation of the concentration of a pollutant at an environmentally
sensitive target and its uncertainty. The computational framework builds upon existing computational tools such as HYDRO_GEN [[1]](#1),FloPy  [[2]](#2), and a 
GPU-based random walk particle tracking code [[3]](#3). The goal is to provide a ``user friendly'' platform that generate outputs that are relevant to risk analysis in groundwater systems.
