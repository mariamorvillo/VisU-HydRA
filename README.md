# VisUQ-HydRA
We propose a computational framework that links the various components relevant for the estimation of the concentration of a pollutant at an environmentally
sensitive target and its uncertainty. The computational framework builds upon existing computational tools such as HYDRO_GEN [[1]](#1),
FloPy \citep{bakker2016scripting}, and a GPU-based random walk particle tracking code \citep{rizzo2019par2}. The goal is to provide a 
``user friendly'' platform that generate outputs that are relevant to risk analysis in groundwater systems.
